# Pentesting Scripts
A collection of scripts I created to make offensive penetration testing easier.

1. ./ipscan.sh {ip_addr}: This script conducts an nmap scan on a provided ip and follows with directory fuzzing. [gowitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness) is used to screenshot all pages.
